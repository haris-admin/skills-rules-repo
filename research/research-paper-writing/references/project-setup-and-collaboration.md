# Compute Budgeting and Multi-Author Coordination

Supplementary Phase 0 (Project Setup) guidance: tracking compute spend and setting up multi-author collaboration workflows. Load this when a project has a real compute budget to manage or 3+ authors to coordinate.

## Compute Budget Tracking

Before running experiments, estimate total cost and time:

```
Compute Budget Checklist:
- [ ] API costs: (model price per token) × (estimated tokens per run) × (number of runs)
- [ ] GPU hours: (time per experiment) × (number of experiments) × (number of seeds)
- [ ] Human evaluation costs: (annotators) × (hours) × (hourly rate)
- [ ] Total budget ceiling and contingency (add 30-50% for reruns)
```

Track actual spend as experiments run:
```python
# Simple cost tracker pattern
import json, os
from datetime import datetime

COST_LOG = "results/cost_log.jsonl"

def log_cost(experiment: str, model: str, input_tokens: int, output_tokens: int, cost_usd: float):
    entry = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "experiment": experiment,
        "model": model,
        "input_tokens": input_tokens,
        "output_tokens": output_tokens,
        "cost_usd": cost_usd,
    }
    with open(COST_LOG, "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(entry) + "\n")
```

**When budget is tight**: Run pilot experiments (1-2 seeds, subset of tasks) before committing to full sweeps. Use cheaper models for debugging pipelines, then switch to target models for final runs.

## Multi-Author Coordination

Most papers have 3-10 authors. Establish workflows early:

| Workflow | Tool | When to Use |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Overleaf** | Browser-based | Multiple authors editing simultaneously, no git experience |
| **Git + LaTeX** | `git` with `.gitignore` for aux files | Technical teams, need branch-based review |
| **Overleaf + Git sync** | Overleaf premium | Best of both — live collab with version history |

**Section ownership**: Assign each section to one primary author. Others comment but don't edit directly. Prevents merge conflicts and style inconsistency.

```
Author Coordination Checklist:
- [ ] Agree on section ownership (who writes what)
- [ ] Set up shared workspace (Overleaf or git repo)
- [ ] Establish notation conventions (before anyone writes)
- [ ] Schedule internal review rounds (not just at the end)
- [ ] Designate one person for final formatting pass
- [ ] Agree on figure style (colors, fonts, sizes) before creating figures
```

**LaTeX conventions to agree on early**:
- `\method{}` macro for consistent method naming
- Citation style: `\citet{}` vs `\citep{}` usage
- Math notation: lowercase bold for vectors, uppercase bold for matrices, etc.
- British vs American spelling
