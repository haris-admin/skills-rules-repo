# Slop Diagnostic: Score Before You Fix

AI design slop has a tiny, predictable failure distribution — designers asked to label AI UIs collapse the "this is AI" signal down to about ten tells. Before polishing or repairing an artifact, run this as an explicit self-audit and write a short report. **Diagnose first, treat second** — auditing and fixing in one breath fails, because the model's prior outweighs the instruction and it repeats the mistake (recolors when it needed re-layout, polishes type on a composition problem).

The ten tells (presence of each = one point of slop; lower is better):

1. **Tech gradient** — blue/violet/indigo glossy gradient on everything.
2. **Generic tech hue** — the default accent is indigo/violet (not chosen for the brand, just the model's favorite).
3. **Feature-tile grid** — icon + heading + sentence × 3, all equal weight, nothing prioritized.
4. **Accent rail** — a colored left strip on cards: decoration pretending to be organization.
5. **Unearned blur** — glassmorphism with no real depth/elevation system behind it.
6. **Monument stat** — oversized numbers filling space that should carry product story.
7. **Icon topper** — a rounded-square icon centered above every heading (Tailwind-template filler).
8. **Center stack** — everything centered because no real composition was committed to.
9. **Default type** — Inter (or system-ui) used by default rather than chosen.
10. **Wrong surface** — the composition doesn't match the surface (e.g. a hero on a Monitor surface). This is the root cause behind most of the others.

How to run it:

- Score the artifact out of 10 (10 = maximum slop). State the score and list which tells fired, in one short report.
- Treat the report as **context, not a to-do list** — it tells you *where* to spend repair effort, it does not dictate edits.
- Then repair, matched to the diagnosis:
  - tells 3, 8, 10 → **re-layout / re-compose** (revisit the surface choice — do not recolor).
  - tells 1, 2, 9 → **recolor / re-typeset** (palette and type are genuinely the problem here).
  - tells 4, 5, 6, 7 → **remove the decoration**; replace it with real hierarchy (scale, weight, spacing).
- Re-score after repairing. Do not declare done while compositional tells (3, 8, 10) are still firing — those are causes, the rest are usually symptoms.

The point of separating diagnosis from treatment: let the audit complain first, then fix only what it complained about, in the register the complaint calls for.
