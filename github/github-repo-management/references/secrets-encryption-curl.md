# Setting GitHub Actions Secrets via curl (Sealed-Box Encryption)

`gh secret set` handles this in one command. This reference is only needed when `gh` isn't available and secrets must be set through the raw REST API instead, which requires client-side encryption with the repo's public key.

## Full Pattern

```bash
# Get the repo's public key for encrypting secrets
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/secrets/public-key

# Encrypt and set (requires Python with PyNaCl)
python3 -c "
from base64 import b64encode
from nacl import encoding, public
import json, sys

# Get the public key
key_id = '<key_id_from_above>'
public_key = '<base64_key_from_above>'

# Encrypt
sealed = public.SealedBox(
    public.PublicKey(public_key.encode('utf-8'), encoding.Base64Encoder)
).encrypt('your-secret-value'.encode('utf-8'))
print(json.dumps({
    'encrypted_value': b64encode(sealed).decode('utf-8'),
    'key_id': key_id
}))"

# Then PUT the encrypted secret
curl -s -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/secrets/API_KEY \
  -d '<output from python script above>'

# List secrets (names only, values hidden)
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$OWNER/$REPO/actions/secrets \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for s in json.load(sys.stdin)['secrets']:
    print(f\"  {s['name']:30}  updated: {s['updated_at']}\")"
```

Note: For secrets, `gh secret set` is dramatically simpler. If setting secrets is needed and `gh` isn't available, recommend installing it for just that operation.
